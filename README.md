#Microservices with .NET 8

Building microservices using .NET. We build everything completely from start to finish:

- Building two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern.
- Working with dedicated persistence layers for both services
- Deploying our services in a Kubernetes cluster
- Employing the API Gateway pattern to route to our services
- Creating synchronous messaging between services (HTTP and gRPC)
- Creating asynchronous messaging between services using an event bus (RabbitMQ)
